# Fontend Mentor - Stats Preview Card Component

First attempt at a mobile-first workflow with just vanilla CSS. It was a bit of a struggle at first, but I can understand why this is the prefered frontend workflow. Also attempted to improve my CSS architecture by implementing global reusable classes whenever I felt like I could.
